# horiseon-code-refactor

The Project that I worked on here in this challenge was to make a already existing website more accessible. 

I took the starter code and took out most of the DIV html elements and put in actual names for certain html elements. 

I used words such as (aside, li, ul, nav and others.)

This project was fairly fun to work on there was a couple bumps in the road but I figured it out with the help of w3 schools and a youtube video on how to set up the project. 

Both links here. 
https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_elements.asp
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eDmY17-GuLo&ab_channel=PaulKeldsen-WebDevelopment

The video is only how to set up the repo and not any of the actual coding itself (I didnt want it to seem like I am cheating.)

I checked the source code on my index. html when I pulled it up on google and there shows a lot more DIVs then there are in my actual code.

I left a couple div's due to me not fully getting it.
